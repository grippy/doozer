# This is the default ApplicationHelper. 
# Place methods here which are global to your application.
# By default all controllers include this file.
#
# To load a helper file into a controller:
#
# Example:
#
#   -files: app_root/app/helpers/helper1_helper.rb, app_root/app/helpers/helper2_helper.rb
#
#   -declare inside controller: self.require_view_helpers=[:helper1, :helper2]
#
# By default all helpers are automatically included into the base partial class.
#   Be care to avoid methods with the same names between helper modules.
#   The helpers are included alphabetically by file name
module ApplicationHelper
